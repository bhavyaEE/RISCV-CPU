# Lab-4 #

## Task 1 ##
- My part of the task included changing the PC counter to either increment by 4 or be the addition of the immOP and PC depending on the PCsrc from the control unit.

- I implemented this using a separate countmux.sv modules which represented the multiplexer switching between the jump and branch

- I also created a Reg module so that the new PC instruction is stored within the register and can be implemented in the next clock cycle.

-Finally i created a top module called toppc.sv which would combine both modules to take in the current pc and ImmOp and output the new PC depending on PCsrc.

What could have been done differently:
- I could have created the mux within the top level insted of creating a new module.

## Task 2 ##
- My task includes
